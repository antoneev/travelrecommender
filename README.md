# Predicting the Price of a Used Car :oncoming_automobile:

<h2> Regression Problem </h2>

This project was built by **Antone Evans Jr.,  Abilash Vanam, and Srikar Reddy Mandli** during the summer of 2020. We decided to build a simple regression problem which would predict the cost of a used car based required features - manufacturers, models, transmission, color, engine_fuel, engine_type, body, state, drivetrain, odometer_value, year_produced, engine_has_gas, engine_capacity, has_warranty, is_exchangeable, number_of_photos, up_counter, duration_listed.
