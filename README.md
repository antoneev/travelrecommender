# Predicting the Price of a Used Car :oncoming_automobile:

<h2> Regression Problem </h2>

This project was built by **Antone Evans Jr.,  Abilash Vanam, and Srikar Reddy Mandli** during the summer of 2020. We decided to build an end to end regression problem which would predict the cost of a used car based required features - manufacturers, models, transmission, color, engine_fuel, engine_type, body, state, drivetrain, odometer_value, year_produced, engine_has_gas, engine_capacity, has_warranty, is_exchangeable, number_of_photos, up_counter, duration_listed. 
 
 Overview:
 1. Finding the dataset
 2. Conduct preprocessing, data exploration and cleaning, model selection and implementation using Jupyter Notebook
 3. Creating the flask server using Python
 4. Testing flask server using Postman
 5. Creating the client using HTML, CSS and JS
 6. Deploying the application to AWS EC2
