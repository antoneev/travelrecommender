# Predicting the Price of a Used Car :oncoming_automobile:

## Regression Problem

This project was built by **Antone Evans Jr.,  Abilash Vanam, and Srikar Reddy Mandli.** During the summer of 2020, we decided to build a simple regression problem which would predict the cost of a used car based on input field. We built a user friend UI where users could not only get predictions but they could add data to our dataset.
